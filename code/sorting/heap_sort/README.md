# Heap Sort
Heap sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. There are two main parts to the process.
* A heap is built from the unsorted data. The algorithm separates the unsorted data from the sorted data.
* The largest element from the unsorted data is moved into an array

## Time Complexity
The overall time complexity is O(nLogn)
